## About Alexander

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/DATA_510x361.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I'm currently a PhD candidate at Dartmouth School of Graduate and Advanced Studies working in the [Christsensen Molecular Epidemiology Lab](http://christensen-lab.com). I'm part of the [Quantitative Biomedical Sciences program](https://dartmouth.edu/~qbs), where my training combines bioinformatics, biostatistics, epidemiology, machine learning, and deep learning to study disease. 

When I'm not thinking about science, I spend my time outside. If you can't get ahold of me, I'm most likely lost in the woods somewhere having a blast.

### Research Interests
<div class="box">
  <p>
  I'm interested in using computational methods to understand the molecular underpinnings of disease. I spend much of my time thinking about epigenetic associations between exposures and disease outcomes, and at the same time my interests are wide. I enjoy working on hard problems with great people. I'm a firm believer that who you work with is as important if not more important than what you work on.

This means that I collaborate widely with a range of scientists and clinicians. If you have an interesting idea or want to chat about an analysis you are working on, please feel free to reach out.
