**Abstract:** With the explosion of data in healthcare, there is a growing need to develop intelligent methods for automatically mining and implementing analyses from these data. In clinical applications, longitudinal patient records are often stored in disparate systems or locations in a non-integreted manner, adding work to providers and researchers to effectively utilize the information. Recent work with treatment recommendation systems has begun to help clinicians overcome these challenges, but there remains a need for concise synthesis, abstraction, and presentation of this temporal information. We present a method for unsupervised classification of common co-occuring medication administration and patient surgical events in electronic medical record data using vector-space analysis and unsupervised cluster classification. This work was done independent of domain expertice and demonstrates a method of identifying co-occuring patient events.
